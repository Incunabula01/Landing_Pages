                 <p><strong>How to make yourself literally IMMUNE to bullets — anywhere you go.</strong></p>
               <p>This is one bulletproof accessory I take with me when I travel. It weighs a fraction of a pound and no one has any idea it can be used to literally block bullets. Check it out on <span class="red">page 38</span>.</p>

                 <p><strong>The one nearly-BLACKLISTED item preppers invariably overlook.</strong></p>
               <p>Though you won’t have to turn to the black market to get this survival item, you won’t find it advertised openly. It can completely incapacitate an attacker if swung even by a 7 year old and it’s so small it clips right onto your keychain. I’ll show you what it is on <span class="red">page 35</span>.</p>

                 <p><strong>When it’s appropriate to bribe a police officer overseas — and how to do it <br class="break">without getting arrested.</strong></p>
               <p>When I was being threatened with jail in a European country, I asked one simple question: “I know I have to pay a fine, how do I do that… can I pay you?” He got $50 and I got to go home. Every spy needs to know how to think on his or her feet. You’ll learn the easiest way In Chapter 8 <br class="break">on <span class="red">page 137</span>.</p>

               <p>Ted Bundy used to walk around on crutches and drop books in front of his victims. And then knock them out when they bent down to pick them up. You won’t believe how else Americans are tricked into dangerous situations (some of them even happen on the highway). But there’s an easy way to see a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Teach everything you learn on <span class="red">page 147</span> to your family as <br class="break">soon as possible.</p>

               <p>Sometimes running away is the best option (I’ll tell you when). Sometimes, handing over your wallet is (I’ll tell you when to do that, too). But sometimes, you don’t want to do either of these things and you need to take ACTION. On <span class="red">page 17</span>, you’ll discover what I taught one of my clients, a petite woman. She used it at a gas station to fend off two attackers all by herself.</p>

               <p>If there’s an emergency, such as a gun-wielding maniac in a shopping mall, do you want to be remembered as the guy who stood there and did nothing? What’s more, most people DIE in emergencies precisely because they did nothing. Here’s how to keep from being “that guy” <br class="break">on <span class="red">page 20</span>.</p>

                  <p class="first-line">Whether it’s the government, your neighbor next door, or the private investigator your wife secretly hired, you want to know if someone’s got their eye on you.</p>
                  <p>In the digital age, they all have the means to spy on you. </p>
                  <p>But fighting back is simple. </p>
                  <p>For example, CIA agents are taught simple techniques to instantly detect if we’re under surveillance — if we’re being followed or spied on. </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p class="first-line">For example, to determine if you’re being followed, simply trick your stalker into doing something that automatically exposes him or her. <strong>It’s a simple three-step process that I’ll reveal to you on page 123.</strong></p>
              <p>Other tricks are even sneakier… </p>
              <p>For example, did you know that you can use an old AM/FM analog radio to detect bugs? All you have to do is tune the AM radio slowly. </p>
              <p>With most bugs, <strong>you’ll hear yourself on the radio once you catch the right frequency.</strong> Sounds strange, but it works. </p>
              <p>Same goes if you’re being tailed in your car. </p>
              <p>If you ARE being followed, the stalker probably put a tracking device on your car as well. And most of them run on the same frequencies as your AM radio. </p>
              <p>Slowly run through the frequencies. If you hear a strong tone, it’s likely there’s a device attached to your car. </p>
              <p>Look, I worked for Big Brother. </p>
              <p>I was inside the belly of the beast. I can tell you with 100% certainty that you’re being watched and your privacy is in jeopardy to a far greater extent than you can possibly imagine.</p>
              <p>Both from your own government, from people who want to do you harm or separate from your money (or identity)... </p>
